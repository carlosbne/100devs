Object-oriented Programming in JS

---- 4 PILLARS ----
Encapsulation -> Group properties and Methods into Objects;      -> Reduce complexity + Increase reusability;

Abstraction  -> Hide some properties and methods from the outside. -> Simpler Interface
             -> Reduce complexity
             -> Isolate the impact of Change

Inheritance -> Define properties and methods into a generator object and other objects inherit this properties and methods. 
            -> Helps to eliminate redundancy code.


Polymorphism -> Refactor statemants
